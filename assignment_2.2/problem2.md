# Problem 2

Write a program which searches for the occurrences of a pattern in a file.
And prints the line number where the pattern occurred.

For example:
Lets say pattern `uint` occurs at line 40 in file try.c

Then passing these arguments to your program should print 
```sh
./program 'uint' path/to/try.c
# Program runs and prints 
Found uint at line 40 in try.c
```

Constraints:
1. Only use C programming.
