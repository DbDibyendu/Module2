# Problem 1

Design a data structure to store a list of known sensors segregated into different types.

For Example:

Type : Temperature sensors   
List - BME280, SHT3x, DHT11, DHT22.

Type : Humidity 
List - BME280, DHT11

So on ..

Design considerations:
1. The data structure must consume very small amount of memory, O(n) is ideal.
2. The time needed to search the data structure must be very small, O(1) is ideal. 

Constraints:
1. Only use C programming 
2. All the data structures used must be supported by C.
