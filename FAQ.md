# Assignments FAQ

## What will the assignments contain?

Assignments contain real world problem statements that will test your skills
that you have learned.

## Pro Tips 
1. Using Google or StackOverflow for solutions to these problem statements 
will actually defeat the purpose of these assignments and is considered as 
**Cheating**. 
2. Try to come up with your own logic for all these problem statements, so that 
these skills get developed.
